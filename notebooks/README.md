# Notebooks exploration

Notebooks are exported to .py files using VSCode "Import notebook to script" functionality.

That way, this is easier to version control.

If you need to recreate the notebook, you can run all cells from any `vsc_notebook.py` file and save result in a notebook using VSCode plugin.

This is similar to Jupytext plugin for JupyterLab.

## Requirements

Just install dependencies through pip.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Pip was chosen to do some quick exploration. No need for more complex package handling.
